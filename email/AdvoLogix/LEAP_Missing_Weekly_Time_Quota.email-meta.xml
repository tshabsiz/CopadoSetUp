    <textOnly>Dear {!advpm__Timekeeper__c.advpm__Staff__c},

Our records indicate that you entered {!advpm__Timekeeper__c.Last_Weeks_Quota_Hours__c} hours for Time last week.

The minimum requirement for time entries is 35 hours a week. To ensure you are compliant with the time capture requirements you should go back into Time and enter at least the minimum requirement for the week.

Please note that you can only enter time 2 weeks either side of the current date so any changes for last week should be made during this week.

Here is the link to access the portal:

Please do not reply to this email as responses will not be monitored.</textOnly>
