    <textOnly>Dear Muriungi,


Thank you for agreeing to participate in the staff pilot, your role as staff pilot users is critical to ensure that NovoFX continuously evolves to meet our clients’ needs.


Some things to note:

- The NovoFX app is a work in progress with only the key functionality enabled. The reason we have taken this approach is to gather as much feedback as early as possible in order to improve the app.

- Although the app is evolving, all account details and transactions are live and in production.

- NovoFX is available for you to use between 09:00 – 17:00 East African Time, 5 days a week.


What happens next?

- You have indicated you are using an Android device and you have shared the email address linked to your Google Play Store account.

- We are adding you to our Staff Pilot Testing Group; once this is complete you will receive an email from us with a link for you to download the NovoFX app onto your device.


Support details:

- Should you need any help using NovoFX, please contact the NovoFX Support Team on +27 11 895 7989 or send an email to:

- Please note that the NovoFX Support Team is available from 11:00 – 17:00 East African Time on weekdays only.
