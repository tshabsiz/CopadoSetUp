    <textOnly>Dear ,


Thank you for agreeing to participate in the staff pilot, your role as staff pilot users is critical to ensure that NovoFX continuously evolves to meet our clients’ needs.


Some things to note:


The NovoFX app is a work in progress with only the key functionality enabled. The reason we have taken this approach is to gather as much feedback as early as possible in order to improve the app.
Although the app is evolving, all account details and transactions are live and in production.
NovoFX is available for you to use between 09:00 – 17:00 East African Time, 5 days a week.

What happens next?


You have indicated you are using an Apple device and you have shared the email address linked to your iTunes account.
We are adding you to our Staff Pilot Testing Group; once this is complete you will receive an email from TestFlight with instructions on how to download the NovoFX app.

How do I register?


To sign up and create a NovoFX profile, follow the easy guide attached.
