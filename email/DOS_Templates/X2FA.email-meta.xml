    <textOnly>Dear

To ensure security against identity theft and other online fraud threats we have a number of systems in place, one of which isTwo Factor Authentication (2FA).

In to be registered for 2FA you need to be registered on either absa online or the absa banking app.
To check which device you have registered as an authorisation device please follow the steps below:

1. Logon to absa online
2. Select the &quot;Full Service&quot; tab
3. Select the &quot;Profile &quot; tab
4. Select &quot;Manage Devices&quot; row
5. Ensure that the device that is listed there is your primary banking device
6. When you transact on NovoFX, your SureCheck notification will appear on your absa banking app on that device.

For more information, please visit your nearest absa branch

Please note: In a case where you are registered for 2FA and your authenticating device is correct it might happen that you still won&apos;t be able to transact on the NovoFX App. We are aware of this issue and our Development Team is working on finding a resolution.</textOnly>
