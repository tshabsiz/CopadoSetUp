    <textOnly>Good day

Please find below a dispute greater than 40 days logged against your company.
Kindly  indicate your response with one of the listed response options, in the response column.
Responses must be returned within 29 days from capture date.
Rejections ( R )must be accompanied by a copy of the signed mandate with the disputing customer.

Responses:
A=          Accept
R=           Reject

Please be advised that voice-recorded mandates are indeed recognized under the PASA clearing rules. However, for the purposes of disputes there is no mechanism to explicitly verify the person on the voice recording. As such, in the instance where the user holds a voice-recorded, the clearing rules are such that the debit dispute is honoured. The resolution moves to the user and the consumer.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. In this instance, we are guided by the clearing rules‚Äù


Kind regards</textOnly>
