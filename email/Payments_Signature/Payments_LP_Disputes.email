Please be advised that voice-recorded mandates are indeed recognized under the
PASA clearing rules. However, for the purposes of disputes there is no
mechanism to explicitly verify the person on the voice recording. As such, in
the instance where the user holds a voice-recorded, the clearing rules are such
that the debit dispute is honoured. The resolution moves to the user and the
consumer.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. In this instance, we are
guided by the clearing rules‚Äù</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br>
Kind regards<br>
