    <textOnly>Dear {!Target_User.FirstName}

We have noticed that you have not logged into Salesforce for 30 days.



We would really like to hear reasons as to why you would not want to use Salesforce to be part of an awesome collaborative experience across BAGL.



Note that should you not logon to Salesforce in the next 60 Days your account will unfortunately be deactivated which is definitely not what we would like to see.

Kindly contact us if you are experiencing any difficulties using Salesforce.



Best Regards
